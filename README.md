You can also refer to www.kofc.org (Head office of membership).
Please also if possible, have a mobile device auto-adjustment.

**Is there a timeframe you’d like this project completed in? Additional modifications will take time.**

**Who is your current website hosted through, and are we sticking with them or moving to a new provider?**

https://www.astralinternet.com
Yes i want to keep my provider.

**Do you want full support for Internet Explorer and Firefox or mainly Chrome? To my knowledge some of your clientele is older, so it wouldn’t hurt to have support for them, though it will take a bit more effort to get everything working in that regard.**

Many people of our association don’t make difference between IE, CH, Fox, … So try to have full support for IE.
